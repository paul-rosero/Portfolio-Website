                            As stated before, my name is Paul Rosero. I am Ecuadorean American, Stony Brook University, New York College of Health Professions and Flatiron School Alumni. I enjoy learning everything I can as much as I can. I have a bachelors degree in Biology and an Associates degree in Occupational Studies. I have had the opportunity to work with so many people throughout my life. I have accomplished a lot of things in 20 years, but I am more excited and ready to see what I accomplish in the next 20+ years to come.

                            I started working part-time back in 2000, at a small drive-thru grocery store called Dairy Barn. Within a 1 year and half I became full time manager that could do both open or close the store. In 2002, while working full-time as a manager, I went to Stony Brook University and graduated (within 4years) with bachelors degree in Biology. In 2007 I left Dairy Barn and started working as a part-time relief aide for Western Suffolk BOCES Schools, by 2009 I became full-time contracted paraprofessional aide. was placed in the Workshop for James E. Allen Jr/Sr High School. There I learned to work as a team to teach students to be able to perform task to improve their mobility or to prepare them to become proficient workers after school.

                            After working there I decided to do something more with the degree I got from Stony Brook and become a Licensed Massage Therapist. While still working at BOCES, I enrolled to New York College of Health Professions January 2012 full time, taking evening and weekend classes. By the end of the 2012 school year, I decided to leave BOCES and dedicate my full time taking classes and working as a tutor for the school. Graduated Dec 2013 with an Associates Degree in Occupational Studies, applied to take the NY state Boards for the licensing of Massage Therapist. Took the test in January 2014 and passed it first time, got the results in March 2014. By then I had a job lined up as a Licensed Massage Therapist working in a chiropractor's office that dealt with no-fault accidents. Started out seeing 10-14 clients a week and after a year, I was seeing about 24-32 clients a week.

                        <p className="paragraph">
                            I moved on from that job in 2015 and found Massage Envy in Garden city, which was totally different way of massaging, new clients; so it felt like I was starting all over again having to build up clientele. After a year working there I saw my hours increase and was doing 10-15 clients a week but driving 45mins - 1hour+ (depending on traffic) was taking a toll on me and started to look somewhere closer to home and found Center for Pain Relief and Wellness Center in August 2016(current job, for now). Was working on both locations until I left Massage Envy in February 2017. This current job was not as busy as the other jobs at first but like previous massage places I had more re-bookings and got busier. Just before 2018 ending I was not being booked as much due to cancellations. So I started to look into doing something different to help equalize the income I was loosing. That is when I found the bootcamp, Flatiron School.

                            In Nov 2018 I enrolled into the Software Engineer Bootcamp Curriculum offered by Flatiron and learned something I never learned before but I use everyday, websites and apps. I learned basic terminology and concepts regarding Ruby, Javascript, NPM, HTML, CSS, Rby on Rails, Sinatra, React/Redux. Learned to implement the material I learned in creating simple web apps or SPA to do basic interactions. After graduation I realized that I needed to learn more in depth and the newer material since some of the things I learned we no longer used or just switched to new code.So after trying to refactor my previous final projects I decided to learn more things so I can be able to have a better user experience.
